# HandSpace 🖐️🌐

**HandSpace** is an interactive web-based prototype that allows users to manipulate 3D models using real-time hand gestures. Built with **Three.js** and **MediaPipe 
Hands**, it demonstrates a lightweight, browser-native approach to spatial interaction without requiring specialized hardware like VR/AR headsets.

**💡 Why HandSpace?**
HandSpace makes interactive 3D learning accessible, affordable, and easy to use. It runs in a web browser using a webcam so students and educators can explore spatial concepts without specialized hardware.

**Key motivations:**

Many classroom concepts are easier to understand when they are shown in 3D ather than explained using flat images, yet they are often taught using static diagrams. During our time as students, we observed how difficult it was for many learners to fully grasp spatial concepts when they were presented from only a single viewpoint.

**How it helps in the classroom:**

- Interactive models let students rotate, zoom, and inspect objects for deeper insight.
- Natural hand gestures provide an intuitive, low-friction interaction method.
- Designed for educators: simple setup and clear demonstrations that enhance teaching and learning outcomes.

By focusing on education, HandSpace aims to support clearer classroom demonstrations and make interactive 3D tools part of everyday learning environments.



## ✨ Features

-   **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Uses Google MediaPipe to track 21 hand landmarks directly in the browser.
-   **Gesture-Based Control**:
    -   � **Rotate Model**: Index finger pinch
    -   🖐️ **Pan Model**: Middle finger pinch
    -   📏 **Scale Model**: Pinky finger pinch
    -   🎥 **Camera Vertical**: Ring finger pinch
    -   🔍 **Zoom Camera**: Two-hand pinch
-   **3D Model Support**: Load and visualize GLTF/GLB models.
-   **Modular Architecture**: Clean, vanilla JavaScript structure separated into Scenes, Models, and Interaction logic.
-   **Zero Backend**: Runs entirely client-side (requires a static file server).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
-   A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) with WebGL support.
-   A webcam.
-   A local static file server (e.g., VS Code Live Server, Python `http.server`, Node `http-server`).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandSpace.git
    cd HandSpace
    ```

2.  **Add 3D Models**:
    -   Place your `.glb` files in the `models/` directory.
    -   Update `src/models/modelLoader.js` to include your new files in the `MODELS` array.
    -   *Note: A fallback model (blue cube) appears if files are missing.*

3.  **Run Locally**:
    -   **Windows (Automated)**: Double-click `run.bat`.
    -   **VS Code**: Right-click `index.html` -> "Open with Live Server".
    -   **Python**:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
    -   **Node**:
        ```bash
        npx http-server .
        ```

4.  **Open in Browser**:
    -   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
    -   Allow camera access when prompted.

## 🎮 Controls

### Hand Gestures
| Gesture | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Index Pinch** | **Rotate Model** | Pinch thumb & index finger, move hand to orbit the model. |
| **Middle Pinch** | **Pan Model** | Pinch thumb & middle finger, move hand to drag the model. |
| **Pinky Pinch** | **Scale Model** | Pinch thumb & pinky, move up to enlarge, down to shrink. |
| **Ring Pinch** | **Camera Vertical** | Pinch thumb & ring finger, move up/down to adjust camera height. |
| **Two-Hand Pinch** | **Zoom Camera** | Pinch both hands (thumb & index), move apart to zoom in, together to zoom out. |

> 📖 **Detailed Instructions**: See [GESTURE_INSTRUCTIONS.md](GESTURE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for comprehensive gesture guides.

**🚀 Future Enhancements**

🤖 AI-Powered Tutor (Primary Focus)

In a future version, HandSpace will integrate the Gemini API to introduce an AI-powered tutor that can explain and guide users through the 3D models displayed on screen.

The AI tutor will be able to:

Explain what the object is and its real-world significance

Describe different parts and internal structures of the model

Answer student questions in natural language

Adapt explanations based on education level (school, high school, beginner)

Support interactive learning, allowing students to rotate, zoom, and explore models while asking questions

This enhancement transforms HandSpace from a simple visualization tool into an interactive educational assistant, combining spatial interaction with conversational AI to improve understanding and engagement.

**🔧 Other Planned Improvements**

Alongside the AI tutor, future versions of HandSpace may include:

Gesture smoothing and stabilization for more precise control

Built-in educational 3D model library (anatomy, geometry, Earth, molecules)

Annotation and labeling tools for live explanations

Voice-based interaction combined with hand gestures

Accessibility enhancements for diverse learners
